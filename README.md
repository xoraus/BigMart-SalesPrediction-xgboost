# BigMart-SalesPrediction-xgboost
Problem Statement: BigMart Sales Prediction ML Project Project - Learn about Unsupervised
Machine Learning Algorithm

Algorithm Features: The implementation of the algorithm was engineered for efficiency of compute
time and memory resources. A design goal was to make the best use of available resources to train the model.
Some key algorithm implementation features include:
Sparse Aware implementation with automatic handling of missing data values.
Block Structure to support the parallelisation of tree construction.
Continued Training so that you can further boost an already fitted model on new data.

# Why Use XGBoost?
The two reasons to use XGBoost are also the two goals of the project: </br>
Execution Speed. </br>
Model Performance.  </br>

XGBoost Model Performance
XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems.
